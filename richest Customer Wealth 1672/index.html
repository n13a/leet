    <h2>Solving Richest Customer Wealth challenge</h2>
    <p>You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​
        customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

        A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the
        customer that has the maximum wealth.
        <br>
        Example 1:
        <br>
        Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
        Output: 6
        Explanation:
        1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
        2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
        Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
        <br>
        Example 2:
        <br>
        Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
        Output: 10
        Explanation:
        1st customer has wealth = 6
        2nd customer has wealth = 10
        3rd customer has wealth = 8
        The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
        <br>
        Constraints:
        <br>
        
    m == accounts.length
    n == accounts[i].length
    1 <= m, n <= 50
    1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100
