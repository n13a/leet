    <h2>Solving Find Center of Star Graph

    </h2>
    <p> There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A star graph is a graph where there
        is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.

        You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between
        the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the given star graph.</p>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h3>Example 1:</h3>
        <span>Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]</span>
        <span>Output: 2</span>
        <span>Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the
            center.</span>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Example 2:</h3>
        <span>Input: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]</span>
        <span>Output: 1</span>
    </div>

    <h3>Constraints:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 <= n <=105</li>
        <li>edges.length == n - 1</li>
        <li>edges[i].length == 2</li>
        <li>1 <= ui, vi <=n</li>
        <li>ui != vi</li>
        <li>The given edges represent a valid star graph.</li>
    </ul>
