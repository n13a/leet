    <h2>Solving Merge Strings Alternately challenge</h2>
    <p>You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting
        with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged
        string.

        Return the merged string.
    </p>
    <br>
    Example 1:
    <br>
    Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
    Output: "apbqcr"
    Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
    word1: a b c
    word2: p q r
    merged: a p b q c r

    <br>
    Example 2:
    <br>
    Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
    Output: 10
    Output: "apbqrs"
    Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
    word1: a b
    word2: p q r s
    merged: a p b q r s
    <br>
    Constraints:
    <br>

    1
    <= word1.length, word2.length <=100 <br />
    word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.
