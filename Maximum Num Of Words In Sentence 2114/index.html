    <h2>Solving Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences challenge</h2>
    <p>A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.

        You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence.

        Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.


        <br>
        Example 1:
        <br>
        Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
        Output: 6
        Explanation:
        - The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
        - The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
        - The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
        Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.
        <br>
        Example 2:
        <br>
        Input: sentences = ["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]
        Output: 3
        Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words.
        In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.
        <br>
        Constraints:
        <br>

       
    1 <= sentences.length <= 100
    1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100
    sentences[i] consists only of lowercase English letters and ' ' only.
    sentences[i] does not have leading or trailing spaces.
    All the words in sentences[i] are separated by a single space.
