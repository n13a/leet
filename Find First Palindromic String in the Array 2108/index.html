    <h2>Solving Find First Palindromic String in the Array
    </h2>
    <p> Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string,
        return an empty string "".

        A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
    </p>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h3>Example 1:</h3>
        <span>Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]</span>
        <span>Output: "ada"</span>
        <span>Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
            Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.</span>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Example 2:</h3>
        <span>Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]</span>
        <span>Output: "racecar"</span>
        <span>Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".</span>
    </div>

    <h3>Constraints:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 <= words.length <=100</li>
        <li>1 <= words[i].length <=100</li>
        <li>words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.</li>
    </ul>
